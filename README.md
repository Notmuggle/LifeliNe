# LifeliNe
we have been working on this from scratch.From scratch means from learning how to code Arduino and is still in the process of developing it further
The first code was used in RoboRave where the Rover used to either move forward or just stop.We useed one Ultrasonic Sensor to do the same.
The second one we developed  in a Makethon that we participated. There we made it to move forward, stop, left and right using two ultrasonic sensors.
The third one we developed for PPTIA semifinals. Where we enabled the whole rover using a bluetooth connection
